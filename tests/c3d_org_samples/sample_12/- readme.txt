This is a single C3D file that contains over 100Mb of 3D data consisting of 364 markers
over a total of 18,178 frames at 60Hz.  The majority of the trajectories are not identified
and have high residuals indicating that the data collection was not good - additional
diagnosis of the problems can be performed by examining the camera mask contriputions.

This is an excellent test file for C3D software applications to examine their ability to 
handle large C3D files and display the marker residuals indicating the data quality. This
sample exists to test a C3D applications ability to read, display and modify physically
large C3D files that contain more than 255 trajectories identified as LABELS and LABELS2.
