Two badly formatted C3D files produced by an early Peak Performance system.  The
data appears to be generated from a force plate vector test but the C3D files
do not contain an ANALOG:FORCE_PLATFORM group to describe the force plates used
or their location in space.

These files illustrate the problems generated when a manufacturer fails to fully
understand the C3D file format but claims to be "C3D compatible" because they
can export data with a C3D file type.
