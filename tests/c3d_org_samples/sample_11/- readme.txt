Two sample C3D files from different laboratories using different 3D systems and different force platforms.
Both C3D files contain unexpectedly noisy analog data in the force plate channels.

evart.c3d	- sample data from a Motion Analysis Corporation user.
21892.c3d	- sample data from a Vicon Motion Systems user.

Both files contain very poor quality analog data due to local lab artifacts.  The Vicon C3D file
appears to have incorrect FORCE_PLATFORM:ORIGIN information.  The Motion Analysis Corporation
file has correct FORCE_PLATFORM:ORIGIN information.
