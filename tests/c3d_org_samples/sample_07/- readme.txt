A sample C3D file that contains 16-bit analog data - note the values for the parameter ANALOG:OFFSET.  The data is stored in PC floating point format as directly sampled values which enables the user to review the data collection performance and correct any configuration errors after the data collection as taken place. Unfortunately the file does not contain any valid 3D data points or significant analog data values.  Many manufacturers have abandoned this method with the result that any data sampling or scaling errors in the floating point samples are hard to diagnose.
