Three sample C3D files produced by a SIMI motion capture system. These file are in floating point
IBMPC format and have their point residuals set to -1 indicating that the data points are invalid.
As a result most C3D applications will report that these files do not contain any valid data points.

These are examples of C3D files that contain data 3D that will not be displayed by
most applications.  The C3D files were generated by a SIMI motion capture system.

The files only contain point data without any associated analog data and are written
in Intel, floating point format.  The files have the floowing problems.

1. All 3D point data co-ordinates have residuals set to -1, signifying that the data points are invalid
   which will prevent most applications form displaying or procesing the data.

2. The 3D point values appear to be scaled in meters, not millimeters but the POINT:UNITS parameter is 
   missing so it's not possible to verify the correct data collection scaling.

3. The file giant.c3d contains duplicate 3D points labels.
