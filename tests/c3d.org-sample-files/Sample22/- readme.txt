A C3D file generated by the BKINtechnologies Dexterit-E software which is controlling a 2D
KINARM robotic exoskeleton for the arm.  The data collected from the exoskeleton is stored
in 2D format.  The file contains EVENT parameters that resemble, but are not identical
to, the Vicon method of parameter based EVENT storage and a large number of undocumented
parameters created by BKINtechnologies.

Creating parameters for a specific data collection and analysis envirnment is completely
supported by the C3D format but they will only be able to be interpreted by third-party users
if they are documented.  As a result this file is completely valid.
