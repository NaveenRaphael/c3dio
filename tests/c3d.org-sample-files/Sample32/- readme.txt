This file demonstrates a problem with importing data from an EMG system via a seperate USB interface,
causing corrupt data that is not properly time frame aligned with the 3D data.  The user thought that 
the data was just noisy but spectrum analysis shows that the data import process from the EMG system
manufacturers USB interface has corrupted the EMG data.
